		<h1>Support my projects</h1>
		<p> Thank you for using apps available on my website, such as <a href="https://genshin.hemlo.cc/partybuilder" target="_blank">Party Builder for Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://bdo.hemlo.cc/leaderboards" target="_blank">Black Desert leaderboards</a>.
		<p> There are no ads here, and all services are free of charge. However, keeping them up costs money, and you can help me pay monthly bills generated by this website by supporting me monetarily. Most importantly, it will show me that services provided here are needed and encourage me to work harder to improve them and create new ones.
		<p> Even if you do not have the resources to help out in the ways below, you can help by sharing my apps with your friends. And, again, thank you for using hemlo.cc, this is what gives me the drive to continue working on it.
		<p class="signature"> Cheers,<br><a href="mailto:man90@tuta.io">man90</a>
